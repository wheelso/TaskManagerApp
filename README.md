# TaskManager App - Assignment 1

# Mobile Appliction Development 1

# Part 1 (Kotlin Program)
- Open `Main.kt` inAndroid Studio
- Run the file right click main.kt and run
- The program will show task titles, filter incomplete tasks, and toggle status

# Part 2 (Android App)
- Open Android Studio
- Create a new project named `TaskManager`
- Use an Empty Activity
- Replace the contents of `activity_main.xml` with the provided layout
- Screenshot the layout preview and emulator screen

# My Approach

# Part 1: Kotlin Basics
I made a Task class with id, title, description, and isCompleted. I added functions to add tasks, show incomplete ones, and print task names. I used simple if-check and loop. The program shows how to use class, list, and function in Kotlin.

# Part 2: Android Layout
I designed a simple layout with a header, input field, button, and list using `LinearLayout`. Proper padding and spacing were added.

# Screenshot Checklist
- Android Studio project setup (Task 2.1)
- Layout preview in emulator or design view (Task 2.2)
